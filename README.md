NANDOne v0.02
===========

Xbox One NAND Filesystem tool

Parses Xbox One Nanddumps for file-adresses and extracts the binary
files. As I only had two dumps to work with, it's probably not
universally compatible and contains bugs for sure :P

Enjoy!

 * Python 2.7
 * Xbox One eMMC NAND Dump


Actions
===========

				to screen
	
	extract		Extracts the parsed entries from SFBX Table

===========
Usage:

Available Action:
	info		Prints the parsed entries
	extract		Extracts nand content
