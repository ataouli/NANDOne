NANDOne v0.02
===========

Xbox One NAND Filesystem tool

Parses Xbox One Nanddumps for file-adresses and extracts the binary
files. As I only had two dumps to work with, it's probably not
universally compatible and contains bugs for sure :P

Enjoy!


Requirements
===========
 * Python 2.7
 * Xbox One eMMC NAND Dump


Actions
===========
	info		Reads adresses from SFBX and GFCU Table and prints them
				to screen
	
	extract		Extracts the parsed entries from SFBX Table
	
	sfbxscan	If the SFBX adress of your NAND isn't contained, scan
				for the MAGIC/Header and append it to the list in the
				python script


Usage
===========
Usage:
	NANDOne.py [action] [dump]

Available Action:
	sfbxscan		Scans for SFBX address
	info		Prints the parsed entries
	extract		Extracts nand content
